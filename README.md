# Tracking-gym-members-exercise
In recent years, personal health tracking has become increasingly popular due to the rise of wearable fitness
devices and health-conscious lifestyles. The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about
gym members, including variables such as age, BMI, body fat percentage, water intake, heart rate (Max_BPM,
Avg_BPM, Resting_BPM), workout frequency, and calories burned. This rich set of data provides an
opportunity to explore how various physiological and behavioral factors interact to influence exercise
performance and health outcomes.

The motivation behind choosing this dataset lies in the desire to better understand how individual
characteristics and habits—such as age, hydration, body composition, and exercise frequency—affect key
performance indicators like heart rate and calorie expenditure. By using data visualization and analysis tools
like Power BI, this project aims to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations that can inform healthier
fitness routines, potentially helping both fitness enthusiasts and professionals make data-driven decisions for
improved outcomes.
